# Builds the GitHub Actions test matrix, splitting slow packages BY TEST.
#
# `gotestsum tool ci-matrix` only distributes whole packages, so one package that
# alone takes minutes leaves every other shard idle. This script keeps ci-matrix for
# the regular packages and splits every package slower than SPLIT_THRESHOLD into
# several shards of top-level tests (balanced with greedy LPT: longest test first,
# into the least-loaded bin). Nothing is hard-coded: slow packages are detected from
# the timings of previous runs, so it keeps working when packages are renamed or moved.
#
# Usage: test-matrix.sh            (writes one JSON object to stdout, logs to stderr)
#   {"include":[{"id":0,"packages":"<import paths>","run":"","estimatedRuntime":"1m4s"}, ...]}
#   run is empty for regular shards, or '^(TestA|TestB)$' for a piece of a split package.
#
# Environment:
#   TEST_SHARDS      shards for the regular (not split) packages. Required.
#   SPLIT_THRESHOLD  seconds; packages slower than this are split by test. Default 90.
#   SPLIT_TARGET     seconds each split shard should take, about. Default 90.
#   TIMINGS_GLOB     gotestsum --jsonfile outputs of previous runs. Default '.test-timings/*.json'.
#   CLUSTER_TESTS    regex of the top-level tests that belong to the cluster lane. Default '^TestCluster'.
#                    The shards run with -skip of this regex, so a split package never distributes these
#                    tests: they are dropped from the list, and "every listed test lands in exactly one
#                    shard" covers exactly the tests the shards run. An empty value disables the filter.
#   ARCHITECTURE_TESTS regex of the top-level tests that belong to the architecture lane (#208). Default
#                    '^TestArchitecture'. Handled exactly like CLUSTER_TESTS: the shards run with -skip of
#                    both regexes, so a split package never distributes them either.
#   PACKAGES_FILE    optional file with the import paths the impact selector chose (one per line). The
#                    script keeps only those of `go list ./...`; without it every package of the module
#                    is planned. A selection that leaves no package is an error, never an empty matrix.
# Requires: go, jq, gotestsum (for the regular packages).
